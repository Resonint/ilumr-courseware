    "The contribution of all the quantum spins' magnetic moments ( $\\vec\\mu$) results in a vector that describes the net direction and magnitude of these spins - this is called the Net Magnetization Vector ($\\vec M$). When placed in the magnetic field ($\\vec B_0$), not all the spins will align with the field, but at thermal equilibrium their net value ($\\vec M$) will align. $\\vec M$ will precess around $\\vec B_0$ at the Larmor frequency (as described in Lab One). When we add energy to the system, using a magnetic field oscillating at the Larmor frequency ($\\vec B_1$), the tip angle of ($\\vec M$) can be changed.\n",

Directly after a 90 degree pulse (which tips $\\vec M$ in the XY plane), energy has been transferred into the spin system and the longitudinal component ($\\vec M_z$) is close to zero. As the spin system loses this energy and returns to thermal equilibrium, the longitudinal component ($\\vec M_z$) regrows. Figure 2 shows this relaxation after a 90 pulse. \n",

Similarly, energy emissions must be stimulated by a transverse magnetic field fluctuating near the Larmour frequency. These field fluctuations occur due to molecular motion of nearby nuclei or electrons. The rate at which individual spins encounter fields fluctuating at the frequency needed for energy transfer is highly dependent on the molecular structure of the material or tissue being measured. This results in a wide range of longitudinal relaxation times across different materials. The time constant that describes the longitudinal relaxation of a material  is $T_1$. \n",

This is because the energy emissions that cause longitudinal relaxation randomly change the direction and phase of a magnetic moment resulting in dephasing in the transverse plane. However, dephasing can also occur without energy transfer into the environment. For example, dipole-dipole interactions cause dephasing without the energy release that affects $\\vec M_z$. The time constant that describes the transverse relaxation properties of a material is called $T_2$. $T_2$ is not to be confused with $T_2^*$. $T_2^*$ decay is much faster than $T_2$ decay and is caused by $\\vec B_0$ field inhomogeneities. However, the dephasing that causes $T_2^*$ decay can be easily reversed and the magnitude of the transverse component restored (see Lab 1 for a more in depth explanation of $T_2^*$). In contrast, the dephasing and loss of signal amplitude associated with $T_2$ relaxation can not be reversed.\n",
