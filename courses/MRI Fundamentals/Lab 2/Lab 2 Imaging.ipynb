The fundamental principle of NMR imaging is to exploit the effect of inhomogeneity to locate the source of an NMR signal in space. To purposely distort the field in a way that is simple to analyse, we will use combinations of coils that create linear **gradients** in the the field strength along the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes (see Figure 1.1).\n",

In fact, with calibration to determine the value of $G_z$, the frequency can be measured and the position calculated by rearranging Equation 1.1.\n",

The frequencies present in the measured signal can be extracted using a Fourier Transform, revealing individual peaks associated with the partitions (See Figure 2.1).\n",

We can imagine slicing the sample into multiple slices along the gradient axis, so that the signals from the slices are similar to the signals from the partitions in Figure 2.1. When the total signal is measured and processed with a Fourier transform, the magnitude of the resulting spectrum at any frequency will be proportional to the amount of sample in the slice that is precessing at that frequency. This means the spectrum is a 1D projection image of the sample.\n",

    "The signal we acquire must generally be Fourier transformed to produce an image, and in order to understand how the pulse sequence and acquisition samples relate to the image obtained it is helpful to use the concept of *k*-space. A *k*-space image is the inverse Fourier transform of the image in physical space (the \"normal\" image). The value of a pixel in a *k*-space image represents the amount of a particular *spatial frequency* (units of radians per meter) in the physical space image, with the centre of *k*-space corresponding to low spatial frequencies and the edges to high spatial frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every discrete sample acquired during the pulse sequence has a *k*-space coordinate depending on the gradients and RF pulses applied so far. For frequency encoding as used in the previous sections, $k_z$ evolves as shown in Figure 4.1. The $180^\\circ$ RF pulse inverts the accumulated phase of nuclei that were excited by the initial $90^\\circ$ pulse, which also inverts the *k*-space coordinate. The pulse sequence is designed so that after the $180^\\circ$ pulse $k_z$ is negative and passes through zero at $T_E$ before becoming positive. In this way we sample along a line segment through *k*-space centred at $k_z=0$."

    "Sampling along a line segment in *k*-space produces a 1D image projected onto a line segment in physical space, and in **Section 3** it was possible to build a rough 2D image by combining multiple 1D projections. In *k*-space, the data acquired lies on line segments through the origin of 2D k-space as shown in Figure 4.2. In principle, instead of processing each line individually with a 1D Fourier transform, we can generalise and apply a 2D Fourier transform to our 2D *k*-space data. In practice this is difficult to do with the data from these line segments because they do not fall in a regular grid, and the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm cannot be used directly. There are advanced data processing techniques that can resample the data into a grid, but these will not be covered in this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we will modify the pulse sequence as shown in Figure 4.3 to cause the *k*-space coordinates to fall into a regular grid. This is done using *phase encoding*, where a gradient pulse is applied before sampling, causing the accumulated phase of precession to change depending on position. After a $y$ gradient pulse with amplitude $G_y$ and duration $t_y$ the final phase at coordinate $y$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\phi = \\bar\\gamma G_y t_y \\cdot y \\tag{4.1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, the $y$ position can be determined from the phase of the signal of a small partition of sample. With a large sample, the signals from different $y$ locations will sum together into a single phase and magnitude, and multiple acquisitions stepping through values of $G_y t_y$ are required to fill the *k*-space grid as shown in Figure 4.4, so that the Fourier transform can be used to separate out the signals from different locations.\n",
