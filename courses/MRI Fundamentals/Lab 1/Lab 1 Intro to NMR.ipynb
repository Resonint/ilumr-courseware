    "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance occurs when a magnetic nucleus (e.g. hydrogen) is placed in an external magnetic field. Using a classical physics model, the nucleus can be thought of as a tiny bar magnet with an orientation and strength represented by its magnetic moment, written as $\\vec\\mu$. Nuclei with nonzero magnetic moment also have angular momentum, so it can also be thought of as a spinning top with the magnetic axis oriented in the same direction as the rotation axis (see the diagram on the right). When placed in an external magnetic field, which we will call $\\vec B_0$, the nucleus will experience a torque pulling it into alignment with $\\vec B_0$. However, because the nucleus also has angular momentum it will not rotate directly into alignment, but instead it will precess around $\\vec B_0$; behaving like a spinning top that is gradually falling over.\n",

When a sample is inserted into the bore, the nuclei will begin to precess around $\\vec B_0$. The individual magnetic moments, $\\vec \\mu$, of all the nuclei in the sample can be combined into a net magnetic moment, $\\vec M$.\n",

    "If a coil is placed around the sample, changes in the component of $\\vec M$ along the coil's axis will produce a measurable current in the coil.

Conventionally, the coil axis is labeled the $x$ axis and the magnetic field direction the $z$ axis. When the nuclei are precessing, $M_x$ will be oscillating sinusoidally due to the rotation of $\\vec M$ around the $z$ axis. The orientations of $\\vec B_0$, $\\vec B_1$, and $\\vec M$ are shown in Figure 1.3 in the conventional coordinate system.\n",

    "After waiting some time, the nuclei in the sample will have reached an equilibrium where $\\vec M$ is completely aligned with $\\vec B_0$ and will not induce any signal in the coil. To obtain a signal, the coil is driven to create a magnetic field $\\vec B_1$ that oscillates at the Larmor frequency, exciting the resonance. After excitation, $\\vec M$ will precess while gradually returning to the equilibrium position, creating a signal in the coil called the Free Induction Decay (FID)."

This is accomplished with a *Match* capacitor.\n",

The probe will only absorb power close to its resonant frequency, so reflected power plot will have a dip at that frequency.

    "All of the isochromats in a sample will come back into perfect phase simultaneously at a single point in time called $T_E$, the echo time, which is where the echo signal is at maximum (see Figure 6.1). The spin echo sequence can only refocus the dephasing caused by magnet inhomogeneity ($T_2^*$); the signal will still have decayed due to random dephasing in the sample ($T_2$), so longer echo times ($T_E$) will result in less echo signal."
