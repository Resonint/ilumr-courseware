Using a classical physics model, the nucleus can be thought of as a tiny bar magnet with an orientation and strength represented by its magnetic moment, written as $\\vec\\mu$. Nuclei with nonzero magnetic moment also have angular momentum, so it can also be thought of as a spinning top with the magnetic axis oriented in the same direction as the rotation axis (see the diagram on the right). When placed in an external magnetic field, which we will call $\\vec B_0$, the nucleus will experience a torque pulling it into alignment with $\\vec B_0$. However, because the nucleus also has angular momentum it will not rotate directly into alignment, but instead it will precess around $\\vec B_0$; behaving like a spinning top that is gradually falling over.\n",

The individual magnetic moments, $\\vec \\mu$, of all the nuclei in the sample can be combined into a net magnetic moment, $\\vec M$.\n",

Conventionally, the coil axis is labeled the $x$ axis and the magnetic field direction the $z$ axis. When the nuclei are precessing, $M_x$ will be oscillating sinusoidally due to the rotation of $\\vec M$ around the $z$ axis. The orientations of $\\vec B_0$, $\\vec B_1$, and $\\vec M$ are shown in figure 3 in the conventional coordinate system.\n",

To obtain a signal, the coil is driven to create a magnetic field $\\vec B_1$ that oscillates at the Larmor frequency, exciting the resonance. After excitation $\\vec M$ will precess while gradually returning to the equilibrium position, creating a signal in the coil called the Free Induction Decay (FID)."

After the $180^\\circ$ pulse the $\\vec M_1$ isochromat will continue to precess faster and the $\\vec M_1$ isochromat slower, but they have been flipped and are now coming back into phase as shown in Fig. 11 (c).\n",
